Select the file you want to edit from browse, and click start. It should create a table with all the entries in it, which will auto increment and decrement the pointers depending on changes in entry size.
If you want to open the solution and take a crack at it yourself, just clone the repo, and open the sln file in visual studio. To actually build the solution, follow normal build instructions for visual studio, which are:
1- Click on build tab.
2- Build solution.

Or if you want to publish your own release, just right-click on the NDSTextEditor in the inspector, and click publish. Configure it the way you like, and publish it.
